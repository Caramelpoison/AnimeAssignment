        <p class="travel">My favorite trip I've ever had was when I went to colorado to snowboard with my friends. <br> 
            There we would get up at 6am to make it to the mountain by 7am. The season was kicking off pretty well as there so many people and so much snow.
        <br> The snow was fresh and powdery. I mostly go on greens and blues. That's as far as my skils will allow me to go.
        <br> Snowboarding is such a strain on the body. I just realized that </p>
